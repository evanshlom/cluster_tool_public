# cluster_tool_public
Machine learning web app that democratizes distance-based clustering with a simple Excel upload template
Web App URL: https://share.streamlit.io/evanshlom/cluster_tool_public/main/cluster_tool.py
Download "Cluster Template.xlsx" then upload that Excel file to the web app, then the app will generate results for your data (you can use the template without changing anything if you intend to test the program)
